Here is a Markdown test post for [Ruhoh](http://www.ruhoh.com).

1. Hate CLI static page generator interfaces? You might hate this.
2. Hate GitHub as a distribution platform as well as a versioning tool? You might hate this.
3. Hate Ruby? You might hate this.

Still, it seems--at the moment--simple enough to work with.
